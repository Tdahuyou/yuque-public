# 例句

"Then I need ask no further," said the clergyman, somewhat hastily rising from his chair.
“这样看来，我就不必多问了，”牧师说着，有点匆忙地从椅子上站起身。

Yet, if the clergyman were rightly viewed, his strength seemed not of the body. It might be spiritual, and imparted to him by angelic ministrations.
然而，如果没有看错的话，牧师的力量似乎并不在身体上，倒是在精神上，而且是由天使通过宗教仪式赋予他的。

Her spirit sank with the idea that all must have been a delusion, and that, vividly as she had dreamed it, there could be no real bond betwixt the clergyman and herself.
她认为一切全都是一场梦幻，她虽然梦得如此真切，但在牧师和她本人之间不可能有任何真实的联系，她的精神随着这种念头而消沉了。
