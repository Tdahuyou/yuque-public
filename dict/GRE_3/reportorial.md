# 例句

The astonishing distrust of the news media isn't rooted in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between reporters and their readers.
对于新闻媒体惊人的不信任，其根源不在于不准确报道和蹩脚的报道技巧，而在于记者和其读者之间世界观的冲突。

That's the opposite of pumping out a bunch of unsubstantiated allegations and then leaving it to readers to "make up their own minds" about them with no reportorial guidance.
这与抛出一堆未经证实的指控，不提供任何报道指向，让读者自己去“判断”的做法正好相反。
