Monet described his attempts to observe and capture the colors in nature thus: “I’m chasing the merest sliver of color.
莫奈如此描述自己观察和捕捉大自然中的色彩的尝试：“我追逐最最细微的色彩。

But this rarely works-after all, a knowledgeable collector isn't going to buy a stolen Monet that he can't display publicly.
但这种情况很少，毕竟知识渊博的藏家不会买一副被盗而无法公开展示的莫奈名画。

Monet said: “Color owes its brightness to force of contrast rather than to its inherent qualities … primary colors look brightest when they are brought into contrast with their complementaries.
莫奈说过：“色彩的亮度，是源于对比的力度，而非其固有特质……原色在与其补色对比时，看起来最亮。”
