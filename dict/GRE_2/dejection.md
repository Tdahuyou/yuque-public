Over the past four years, I have seen his face evolve into picture of dejection.
在过去的四年多的时间里，他的面容逐渐变成一副沮丧的样子。

He was in that condition, the last phase of dejection, in which sorrow no longer flows; it is coagulated, so to speak; there is something on the soul like a clot of despair.
他停留在这种状态，沮丧的最后阶段，这时痛苦已不再发生变化，可以说它已经凝固了；就象灵魂上凝聚着失望一样。

As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.
说到那位先生本人，他可并不显得意气沮丧，也没有表现出要回避她的样子，只是气愤愤地板着脸，默然无声。
