In one of his last letters White defends his hypochondria: “I don't regret the time I spent worrying about myself.
在最后那几年的某一封信中，怀特还为自己的忧郁症做了一下辩护：“花在忧郁上面的时间，我一点都不后悔。”

Nor does he always locate his case studies fully within the history of ideas; he does not quite explain, for example, why the seat of “hypochondria” moved from the bowels to the brain.
就像他总是引用历史上诸多不确定性的论述来解释他的案例一样，他也并没有完全解释忧郁症是怎样从胃肠道与精神相联系。
