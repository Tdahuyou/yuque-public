How much did you spend on that bad toupee?
你在那个劣质的假发上花了多少钱？

His toupee, obviously fitted many years ago, was slightly off centre and barely covered his spreading baldness.
他戴的假发明显是多年以前配的，现在看着有点歪，勉强盖住他日渐扩大的秃顶。

“Look at them, class. They got it.” He clapped his hands, which caused his toupee to slide to the left. “I told you it was easy.” He smiled.
“看看他们，同学们，他们学会了。”他拍手称好，不小心让假发滑到了左侧。“我跟你们说过的嘛，很容易，”他笑道。
