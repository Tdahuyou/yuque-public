# 例句

Instead, the team discovered that the pituitary does not lose its ability to respond to insulin.
这样一来，研究团队发现脑垂体并不会消失对胰岛素响应的能力。

As insulin levels rise with weight gain, the pituitary releases ever higher levels of the fertility-regulating luteinizing hormone.
随着体重增加，继而胰岛素水平上升，脑垂体释放更多调节生育的促黄体激素。

Chronically high levels of luteinizing hormone and other signals released by the pituitary disrupt the natural cycle of fertility hormones that signal the ovaries to release eggs.
由脑垂体持续释放更多的促黄体激素和其他信号，这便破坏了传递信号给卵巢释放卵子的生育激素正常循环。
