# 例句

This means that the mainsail and head sail of a ketch are generally smaller than on a sloop, but the mizzen sail roughly makes up the difference.
这意味着双桅帆上的主帆和前帆通常要比单桅帆船上的小一些，而尾桅帆的面积则恰好弥补了这一差距。

The primary advantages of a ketch are that each of the sails is usually somewhat smaller than on a sloop of equivalent size, making sail handling easier.
双桅帆的主要优势在于每一面帆都比同尺寸的单桅帆船上的相应帆尺寸要小一些，使得航行操纵也容易一些。

So it's not the sail area that matters when deciding between a sloop and a ketch, but differences resulting from having that area spread over three rather than two sails.
因此在决定选择单桅帆船还是双桅帆船时，决定因素并非帆面积，而是将这个帆面积分布在两面帆或是三面帆上带来的相应差异。
